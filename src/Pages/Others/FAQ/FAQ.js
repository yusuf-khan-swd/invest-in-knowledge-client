              <p className="mt-1 text-gray-400">
                FAQ pages continue to be a priority area for SEO and digital
                marketing professionals. An FAQ page is one of the simplest ways
                to improve your site and help site visitors and users. Your FAQ
                section should be seen as a constantly expanding source of value
                provided to your audience. It is a place where their ever-changing
                and growing requirements are not only met but anticipated and
                exceeded frequently.
